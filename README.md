# ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ My Comfy Gentoo Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal digital garden! This is a collection of my configuration files for a minimal, fast, and cozy Gentoo Linux environment. I use these files to keep my workflow consistent and my desktop looking sharp.

> **Note:** Built for my specific hardware (Intel Skylake / HP), but feel free to scavenge anything you find useful!
